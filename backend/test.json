Let me just say that my taste buds are doing the macarena right now!First off, the texture is just right. It's chewy but not too much, and it's not like those other protein bars that taste like you're biting into gravel. These bars are softer than a baby's bottom and they are packed with flavor.Speaking of flavors, have you tried the chocolate brownie one? I don't even know how they did it, but it tastes like a legit brownie. I'm convinced there are tiny little chocolate fairies working tirelessly in the Kirkland factory to make these bars extra delicious.And let's not forget about the peanut butter flavor. It's like eating a spoonful of creamy peanut butter, minus the weird looks from your coworkers. Trust me, I've been there.But the best part? These bars have a jaw-dropping 21 grams of protein. That's more than enough to power through a workout or just power nap on your couch, whichever you prefer.Overall, these Kirkland signature protein bars deserve all five stars and a standing ovation.

The flavor varieties are limited to just these two, but the cost savings depending on where you buy your quest bars can be in the range of $0.60 to $1+ per bar.I tried both bars today. The brownie one is flat out horrible. 0/5 if I could. The flavor profile reminds me of cheap chocolate, and actually trying to eat the bar is essentially like chewing gum. After about chewing my first bite of the bar for about 30 seconds I spit it out and moved onto the next one.The chocolate cookie dough one is subpar at best. Might be worth a 1.5-2/5. I was actually able to chew and swallow my bite of this one, but rather than tasting like cookie dough, or even like a cookie dough imitation, which is what the somewhat okay quest bar version does for this flavor, it instead tastes like it is instead trying to mimic the flavor of something trying to mimic the flavor of cookie dough. So what you end up with is a worse version of the quest bar version of this flavor which is already only alright in its own right, and is one of their weakest bars in their lineup.In the end, someone at Kirkland decided it would be a good idea to take two of the worst quest bar flavors, and then make even cheaper versions of them, which in the end is reflected by the barely palatable taste of each. I wouldn't recommend anyone buying these. I'll try to see if someone I know likes them as maybe they wouldn't mind taking 18 free protein bars.In the end the only way these compare to the quest bars, is in their macro nutrient counts. In the end though, I signed up for 5 boxes of quest bars a month until I get a decent stock pile so I can take advantage of the 15% discount. That puts my price at $20-$21 per box or $1.75 per quest bar compared to ~$1.35 per bar for these. It is well worth the extra $0.40 per bar so I am not revolted by what I am eating and can actually enjoy the product I am paying for.\", \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2017\", \"verified\": \"Verified Purchase\"}; {\"author\": \"Cindy from MN\", \"rating\": \"5.0 \", \"title\": \"great flavor\", \"content\": \"these bars keep you full for four hours.  it takes six hours before you really know you are hungry.  great for diets and summer activity\", \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2023\", \"verified\": \"Verified Purchase\"}; {\"author\": \"HRPuckinfutz\", \"rating\": \"5.0 \", \"title\": \"Doesn't Give Me Gas\", \"content\": \"These protein bars are the only ones that don't give me gas.

I really hate protein powders. They just don't taste good with water, and I can't drink milk so it really limis my options to get the protein I need.Pure protein bars don't have the highest overall protein out of all the bars out there. You will easily find other bars with 30+ grams of protein. However, many of those bars easily have twice as many calories, and as I am trying to lose weight overall while gaining lean muscle mass, I don't really care for 350, 400 calorie protein bars. Most Pure Protein bars have 200 calories or less, while chocolate deluxe only has 180. I think Quest bars are comparable but they don't taste nearly as good (if you think Pure Protein bars are a little chalky, Quest tastes like straight up chocolate chalk) and I have heard horror stories of finding actual debris in those bars. They also cost more.No low calorie low sugar protein bar is going to taste like a special k or other brand bar that isn't specifically formulated for high protein / low calories. But these don't taste bad at all, considering.

If you really want the purest form of protein, eat egg whites or lean meat (Chicken/Turkey Breast, Beef, etc).Ok, that being said, you cannot carry eggs around, that's where this bar comes into picture. It has excellent amount of protein (20g) and low carbohydrate. It tastes absolutely delicious. I have always used (about 4-5 bars in a week) DeTour and Myoplex Protein bars. Detour has about 30g and Myoplex has about 25g of protein but their carb content is higher as well, and so is the calories. I am trying to lose weight, so I am watching both proteins and carbs, also doing cardio 5 times a week. I am not a nutritionist, but I am pretty sure the contents of these protein bars contain mono-saturated fats, which is not so good for our health. So, limit the use of these products as much as you can. Also, it has whey and sugar alcohols (sugar replacement), which can upset stomach for some people. I had that trouble with Detour but got used to it. The important thing is that you drink atleast 8 fl oz of water while taking this. Also, please limit your intake of these bars to 1 per day due to sugar alcohol presence.Recently, I have done a lot of research and it's best to eat whole grains and vegatables/lean meat to lose weight, instead of taking supplements.

On top of that, you get 20g protein, 17g carbs, and not too much fat. Lots of protein bars are loaded up with saturated fats which is something you really have to look out for (these bars have only 3g saturated fat). Another thing you should look out for is that a lot of protein bars are loaded up with sugar whereas the Pure Protein bars have almost none. Just as a note, large amounts of sugar are good if you are having the bar right after a workout because the high glycemic index sugars replenish your body's glycogen levels quickly, but if you're having the bar any other time of day you don't want a lot of sugar (you should be having your protein in liquid form after a workout anyway).

        "reviews": "{\"author\": \"Donuts\", \"rating\": \"5.0 \", \"title\": \"Great tasting snack...if you get the Japanese Pocky\", \"content\": \"I bought these back in January and never got around to reviewing them. I had heard many people rave about a Japanese snack called Pocky so I figured I would try it out. Just like the description states, its a biscuit stick covered in chocolate. I wouldn't say the taste is mind boggling but its very easy to eat and virtually no mess, well, as long as the chocolate doesn't melt. Anyways, in case anyone is wondering, I ordered from a seller named Very asia (amazon.com/gp/help/seller/at-a-glance.html?ie=UTF8&isAmazonFulfilled=0&orderID=103-7071944-5595443&marketplaceSeller=1&seller=A3JW437I54SEI1). I believe it took around a 3 weeks to actually get to me (maybe it had to be imported) but when it did, it came well packed and not damaged whatsoever. I'm definitely considering re-stocking on this in the future if I can't find a local storeEDIT: Oct 11, 2012*****Inquire the type of pocky from seller before finalizing purchase*****So I decided to restock after I couldn't fight the craving anymore. Unfortunately the batch this time was not so good (ordered from different seller because it was cheaper and through Amazon Prime). What I received was not the picture shown on the front page (2 per pack japanese pocky), it was a 1 per pack pocky~ish thing from Thailand. In my opinion, the 1 giant pack compared to 2 smaller packs is definitely a step back. Packaging was fine and I ordered in October when the weather was a bit cooler aka no melted chocolate arriving at the front door. The sticks were coated in some type of thick chocolate that was a bit bitter to the taste, more similar to dark chocolate than milk chocolate. The original Japanese pocky melted almost immediately in your mouth, this one melts slowly as it sits in your mouth.Personally I like the taste of dark chocolate but not when used here as a pocky flavor. I also have terrible self control so I buy things that come in small portions in order to a) not eat everything at once and b) avoid making the fridge a mess by cluttering it with tons of opened items. I can honestly say that I won't be overeating when it comes to this batch of pocky because I and my stomach dislike it so much. I won't change my original rating because that still holds true for the Japanese pocky but if I were to rate only the Thailand pocky it would be a 3. The taste isn't \\\"terrible\\\" but its definitely not to my liking. If possible I will be uploading some pictures of what I received.\", \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2011\", \"verified\": \"Verified Purchase\"}; {\"author\": \"Aunt B\", \"rating\": \"5.0 \", \"title\": \"Tasty Snack, Suggest not ordering in Summer Time\", \"content\": \"Tasty crunchy biscuit stick.  Not bitter, not too sweet.  Really like this single serving of Pocky.  The package says \\\"Chocolate Cream\\\" but it tastes more like dark chocolate to me (yum!)I see that others are disappointed with the portion of the product.  Please look at the images and Product Description before ordering to ensure you are getting what you want. I can only find these single serving boxes at one place that is about 40 miles away from my home.  It is convenient and awesome that I can shop at Amazon.com and find this treat at about the same price as at that store of mine (at time of writing this is $1.02 here at Amazon).The packaging at the time of this writing is a single serving which is 24 sticks. The box has a scored top so you can pull the cardboard back and have a container to hold the sticks in (see photo).  Tear the top of the sealed mylar  bag and the biscuit part is presented with the chocolate side down so you only need to touch the biscuit. [I added pictures in the Customer Images of the product]If you never had Pocky before, give them a try!!!  However, I warn you to consider the outside temperatures before ordering any chocolate products online.  I did not consider it as I ordered a couple boxes for myself (in Texas) and sent a few to a friend of mine in Idaho in the month of July.  I just did not think about it.  It was discouraging to learn my friend, who never tried Pocky, was met with a package of biscuit sticks that were melted together and has to eat them in broken pieces as they bust when she tries to pull them apart (the chocolate firmed up on her).  She still said she likes them, said the taste is great.At my house, my packages are also melted together; however, the chocolate is still soft as well... my house is about 80 degrees at the moment.  I can pull mine apart with a bit of a mess as the chocolate does as chocolate will do.  I don't mind too much as I get to lick my fingers off and feel like a little kid once more (awesome right?!?!).  But it isn't any sort of treat to give to a guest as the presentation is well... messy.  Unless that is cool with your guests then Go For It!!!!!That being said, I think this product is great if you like a bit of dark chocolate with a light, crispy biscuit.\", \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2014\", \"verified\": \"Verified Purchase\"}; {\"author\": \"M. Thompson\", \"rating\": \"5.0 \", \"title\": \"I love this snack!\", \"content\": \"I'm not sure how you review something that's as subjective as taste, but suffice to say that if you like chocolate and graham cracker, you'll like this (it doesn't taste exactly like either of those, but that's the closest analogy for me).  The sticks themselves are a cracker of some kind, dipped in chocolate, with one end left just normal cracker to you don't get your fingers covered in chocolate while eating.Here's some of the nitty gritty details - each of the boxes contain two individually sealed packets, that contain probably 20 or so of the sticks.  The packets themselves are really cleverly designed, with a little slit cut in the folded part, you just grab both sides and pull, and it opens up the package without any hassle - gotta love Japanese product design!  :)  Another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the grabbing-side of the stick is right at the top.Each of the packets has 210 calories (90 from fat), and about 80mg of sodium - so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option.  It does contain milk, wheat, soybeans and sheanut - so if any of these are an issue for you, then you'll want to pass.  It also says on the packaging that the facility they're manufactured in also processes eggs and peanuts - the product doesn't use either of them, but the disclosure is nice if you're particularly sensitive to either.Overall a great snack at a great price - the 10 pack really is 20 of the packets, so that's quite a few snacks.  One note, if you live in a hot climate, don't order them in the summer because they will melt together (in shipping)!

I was expecting a snappy texture, but these squares were more chill than my grandma's Sunday afternoon crossword session.Now, let's chat about the flavor, or should I say the MIA flavor? Organic white cheddar sounds fancy, right? Well, these squares made me question my taste buds. I was looking for a cheese explosion, but it was more like a cheese murmur. I mean, come on, Annie! Where's the cheese party you promised?And can we talk about the uniformity? These squares are so perfectly shaped; I feel like I'm snacking on cheese-flavored graph paper. I miss the days when snack crackers had character, you know, like they'd been through a wild party in the snack factory.Look, Annie's, I love your commitment to being all organic and stuff, but let's not forget the snack part of the snack.

Good experience, so I thought I\\u2019d try some Fritos. I hadn\\u2019t eaten them in years, but remembered them as being a simple tasty snack. Good price when you compare to a vending machine offering or a mixed bag of snacks from the grocery store. Delivery was prompt, The Amazon Order Chauffeur was polite as he handed me the box, covered by another package containing an order for my wife. When I got inside, I noticed the tape sealing the top of the box was a bit weathered-looking. Sadly, closer inspection revealed that it looked like the tape had been picked at like an old scab and slid away to allow access to the box. \\u201cHeaven\\u2019s to Murgatroid\\u201d, I said to myself, as I slid the tape aside and accessed the contents as I suspected someone may have done before me.  I carefully removed the packages of Fritos, counting as I went. Thirty-nine, not forty. I counted again. 39/40ths of the delivery had survived the journey from Frito-lay to my door. I was crestfallen. A thief had intercepted my order of Fritos while it was in the hands of the manufacturer or the Amazon delivery system. My first thought was beneficial as I considered that maybe someone within the Fritos or Amazon empires was sadly hungry and perhaps wasn\\u2019t able to provide for their spouse and children. If I\\u2019d encountered them on the street while carrying a box of 40 packages of Fritos, I\\u2019d without a doubt offer more than a single package to help them out. My second thought was less generous as I considered that the individual who took advantage of an opportunity to purloin a package of Fritos had done more than grab a quick snack. They\\u2019d made me realize that I couldn\\u2019t trust Amazon to deliver anything to my home without the fear that someone within the system could easily f*** with my order. Being a food product, it was clear that removing one of 40 packets was not all that could have occurred. I looked at my options. There didn\\u2019t appear to be a way to complain other than to leave a review comment, which would probably be overlooked by many and read by few, most notably someone that I would typically consider eligible to hear a complaint. I could suck it up and just hope that the Frito Bandito hadn\\u2019t left anything behind other than a disgruntled customer. The difference between receiving 40 or 39 bags of Fritos is in the fraction range, so it\\u2019s not the cost. No, it\\u2019s the principle! I decided to return the product. The packaging and the contents were both damaged by the Frito Bandito, meaning I didn\\u2019t receive what I\\u2019d ordered. I entered the complaint system and took a look at something new for me. I could get a refund or I could get a replacement. I considered the taste memory of a bag of Fritos. I\\u2019ll go for the replacement, I thought. My wife had discovered that Amazon had made it easier to return things to Amazon, so I thought it would be easy to drop the fouled box of Fritos and wait for another. Here it is two days later and I have a fresh box of Fritos that hasn\\u2019t been obviously intruded upon by the Frito Bandito or any other scalawags. I\\u2019m feeling better. Frito-Lay said keep the original box, as well. That\\u2019s very generous. I like that, but will probably donate it. It has restored my faith to a degree, though and I\\u2019ll probably be ordering again.

They taste entirely normal to me and offer a perfect mix of saltiness and sweetness with that unique and unmistakable taste of peanuts. At one point, I really enjoyed Power Crunch peanut butter creme protein wafer bars but even those had an unmistakable artificial sweetener taste to them. These don't taste artificial at all so I do believe their claim that these don't contain any artificial sweeteners. I love love love these. Bye bye power Crunch. In fact, these are dangers to have around cuz I might eat too many at a time. They will be perfect for my international flight coming up. I suspect I won't be meeting my daily protein goals by just eating the meals provided by the airline.The only thing is , I'm pretty sure the peanut butter coating will melt if these bars are kept in a backpack/ container/ glove compartment in hot weather.

These bars are a true joy, offering a delightful combination of flavor and wholesome ingredients that will satisfy your cravings without any guilt.First and foremost, let's talk about taste. These bars are an absolute treat for the taste buds, with a rich and indulgent flavor profile that makes them taste more like a decadent dessert than a protein-packed snack. The sweet and salty combination of caramel, sea salt, and peanuts is simply irresistible, offering a burst of deliciousness in every bite. It's hard to believe that something so delicious can also be so nutritious!What sets these bars apart is their thoughtful ingredient list. Peanuts take center stage as the #1 ingredient, providing a natural source of protein and a rich, nutty flavor that shines through with every bite. This focus on real, wholesome ingredients is truly refreshing, and it's evident from the first taste that these bars are made with care and attention to quality.In addition to being delicious, these bars are also nutritious. With 20g of protein per serving, they're the perfect snack for fueling up on the go or satisfying hunger between meals. Plus, they're keto-friendly, with low carbs and low sugar, making them an excellent option for those following a low-carb lifestyle. And with 0g of added sugar and just 1g of total sugar, you can enjoy them guilt-free, knowing that you're making a smart choice for your health.But it's not just about what's in these bars \\u2013 it's also about what's not. If it was not necessary, KIND did not include it. They're gluten-free, kosher,  contain no sugar alcohols or artificial sweeteners and no GMOs, if those sorts of things matter to you. This means you can feel good about enjoying them, knowing that you're nourishing your body with wholesome, clean ingredients.In terms of convenience, these bars are amazing. Whether you're grabbing a quick snack on the go or fueling up for a busy day, they're the perfect option for busy lifestyles. They're portable, easy to stash in your bag or desk drawer, and ready to enjoy whenever hunger strikes. Plus, with their satisfying texture and indulgent flavor, they'll keep you satisfied and energized throughout the day.Overall, I can't recommend the KIND Protein MAX Sweet & Salty Caramel Peanut Crisp Snack Bars highly enough. They're delicious, nutritious, and convenient \\u2013 everything you could want in a snack.

Each bar is, I would say, perhaps twice the size width-wise of an average granola bar and serves as a reasonably filling snack. In terms of flavor, KIND struck a good balance here. The peanuts and caramel are both definitely present, yet at a good balance so that neither of those flavors feels overpowering. The peanuts themselves also live up to the \\\"crisp,\\\" with each bite having an appreciable crunch to it.I'm also happy to say that, for protein bars that emphasize peanuts so much, I expected that they would be messier to eat, but the bars actually hold together very well even as you bite into them. As a side note, these are definitely fresh with a far off expiration date, so they'll keep in the cabinet for a good while.

If you've had a cholecystectomy, like me, then you'll want to avoid this product unless you enjoy spending all night in a bathroom in absolute agony. It's going to be a fun evening for me. Some fat is fine and some fiber is also fine, but eating something high in both - generally over 10% - is going to cause some serious problems for some people.

There were a few broken chips in the bottom of the cans from shipping but only a few. You always have to worry about that with pringles because they are notorious for having broken chips. Nothing worse than a canister of Pringles dust! So far these look great. These shipped fast and showed up fresh and in great condition. As far as sour cream and onion chips go, Pringles are on the milder end of the flavor spectrum. They have a mild sour cream and onion taste and are pretty mellow. To me they have less flavor than Lay's, Ruffles, or Utz sour cream and onion chips. That is a good thing to some people because some other brands might have too much sour cream or onion.

The sea salt seasoning provided a hint of anticipation for the burst of flavor that was about to come.In terms of taste, these Popcorners do not disappoint. The sea salt seasoning is perfectly balanced, enhancing the natural taste of the popped corn without overpowering it. Each triangular piece is generously coated with just the right amount of salt, making them a savory treat that's hard to put down.The crunchiness of these Popcorners is one of the highlights. They have a satisfying texture that's crisp and light, making them an enjoyable snack to munch on.I appreciate that Popcorners are popped, not fried, which makes them a healthier option compared to traditional potato chips or other fried snacks. It's nice to indulge in a tasty treat without the guilt.The 7-ounce bag is a good size for individual snacking or sharing with friends and family. It's also great to have on hand for movie nights or as a convenient option to pack in lunch boxes.One of the best things about Popcorners is their versatility. They are delicious on their own, but they can also be paired with dips, salsa, or even used as a crunchy topping for salads.I appreciate that Popcorners Sea Salt are gluten-free, which makes them suitable for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease.One thing to note is that, like any crunchy snack, portion control is essential to avoid overindulgence.In conclusion, Popcorners Sea Salt is a crunchy and flavorful snack that I highly recommend. Whether you're looking for a savory treat to enjoy on its own or a versatile option for pairing with dips and more, these Popcorners deliver on both taste and texture. With their perfectly salted flavor and satisfying crunch, they are a fantastic choice for anyone seeking a delicious and guilt-free snack.

ETA: White Cheddar=awesome\", \"content\": \"I had never tried these before I bought them from Amazon.  -A bit risky, yes, I know.  But with the majority of reviews being GREAT, I figured why not?  I'm glad that I took a chance...they're pretty darn good!  I really wanted to add to my \\\"low fat dry snack\\\" collection, to give a little more variety to the usual Pop Chips or Pirates Booty.  I'm happy to say that these Popcorners will be added to that collection.As for the taste, I was worried this would taste like Pop Chips Katy's Kettle, but they do not.  The texture is softer and crisp; not hard/gritty, like Pop Chips' Kettle version can be.  The kettle corn flavor is authentic, and isn't just a flavor coating...the entire chip is flavorful.  Although, I do think that they could cut back on the salt just a little.  There's a salty aftertaste that gets stronger as you eat more.  They're still delicious and I would definitely buy again, but it would be nice to not have as much of a salty aftertaste.Overall, if you're looking for a sweet yet salty low fat snack, give these a try!ETA: Amazon only allows one review, even though I've ordered the different flavors separately, so I'm adding in my opinion on the White Cheddar flavor:Ever tried Smartfood White Cheddar Popcorn?  That's almost exactly what Popcorners White Cheddar tastes like, minus those annoying hard pieces in the Smartfood's popcorn.  -Anyone who's eaten Smartfood's popcorn knows what I'm talking about with those random hard-as-a-rock pieces that you always encounter.  So basically, if you like the taste of Smartfood's popcorn, you will LOVE Popcorner's version!  It's simply delicious, with the perfect balance of saltiness and cheddar.  I've tried this flavor, the Kettle (as mentioned above), and the Sea Salt flavor.  The Sea Salt & Cheddar are definitely my favorites thus far, but I'm planning on trying the other ones, too.  I've finally seen most flavors in my grocery store, for relatively cheap ($1.50-$2)  I'm going to try the Jalapeno next, and add to this review after. :)\", \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2014\", \"verified\": \"Verified Purchase\"}; {\"author\": \"GrandmaCarol\", \"rating\": \"5.0 \", \"title\": \"If You Haven\\u2019t Tried You Need To\", \"content\": \"The first time I tried these I immediately liked them.

Pure Protein has truly nailed it with the flavor of these bars. The lemon cake flavor is refreshingly tangy and perfectly balanced, with just the right amount of sweetness to satisfy your cravings without feeling heavy or overly indulgent. It\\u2019s like enjoying a slice of lemon cake without the guilt.But what really sets these bars apart is their nutritional profile. Each bar is packed with 20 grams of protein, making it an excellent choice for fueling your body and keeping you feeling satisfied throughout the day. Protein is essential for muscle repair and growth, making these bars ideal for post-workout recovery or simply as a mid-day pick-me-up.What\\u2019s more, Pure Protein Lemon Cake Bars are low in sugar and carbs, making them a smart choice for anyone watching their intake of these nutrients. With only a fraction of the sugar found in traditional snack bars, you can enjoy these guilt-free knowing you\\u2019re making a healthy choice for your body.I also appreciate the convenience factor of these bars. Whether you\\u2019re rushing between meetings, hitting the gym, or simply need a quick snack on the go, Pure Protein Lemon Cake Bars are the perfect solution.

Granted, compared to a candy bar, maybe not, but these are protein bars. The ingredients are very good, high protein, low sugar. They are probably the cheapest yet highest quality protein bars on the market. Like I said, they are very good too, just don't expect a candy bar. Will continue to buy.\", \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2024\", \"verified\": \"Verified Purchase\"}; {\"author\": \"Moises\", \"rating\": \"4.0 \", \"title\": \"Slightly better than average\", \"content\": \"This is a typical protein bar. 200 calories with the standard dense and chewy protein with a gritty texture on your teeth and a slightly bitter aftertaste. That type of protein bar has been pretty much boilerplate for years now. The only difference is the combination of nuts or gross chocolate it is covered in.While the protein component of this bar is old hat, the fact it is covered in cake frosting flavored coating makes it taste better than most. So I do prefer this over most bars that try rather unconvincingly to be like a candy bar. I think the addition of a sparse splatter of sprinkles is pointless though. I guess they want to really sell the birthday cake angle, but there are not enough sprinkles to matter and sprinkles are made with dyes that are extremely questionable healthwise so it would be better without them. But aside from flavor, the other selling point is it has a very reasonable fat to protein ratio. This fits my nutritional needs better than most. Seems like all protein products these days try to hide the fat content of their products. Since fat is not an issue or even preferred for keto, I find that most protein bars lately have been jacking up the fat content to improve flavor and texture then just slapping a keto-friendly stamp on the packaging and then only advertise the high grams of protein and low grams of sugar and then avoid mentioning fat anywhere on the box except the nutritional facts chart. Most products advertised as keto-friendly have way more fat than my diet can handle. The fat to protein ratio in this product is 5/20 which is pretty good in comparison to similar products available.I  also ordered the chocolate mint cookie and lemon cake flavors as a subscription which is have not tried yet but expect to be good based on the way the birthday cake tasted. I would have preferred to subscribe to the birthday cake flavor but some flavors were not available for subscription and save, birthday cake being one of them. Another bummer is there is a big price difference depending on flavor. Birthday cake and some of the chocolate flavors were $4 more than the average price and the cookies and cream were $27 per box so nearly double the cost, and also not available by subscription.  I guess it is all coming from different suppliers or whatever so it is what it is. If it were to become available for subscription I'd likely get it. They aren't revolutionary but they are certainly more pleasant to eat than the average. But protein bars have been around for a while and they pretty much have hit a plateau on flavor and texture, so that in mind, these are the best I've had in a while.\", \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2023\", \"verified\": \"Verified Purchase\"}; {\"author\": \"paul v.\", \"rating\": \"5.0 \", \"title\": \"High protein\", \"content\": \"I feel that all these protein bars are a little overpriced and are taking advantage of people who love these things, but I was surprised by the amount of protein in these at 20g and the lower price than other bars of similar comparison.

Some people might attribute this to \\\"healthy ingredients\\\", but I can't tell that the ingredients are any healthier than regular cheezits.Mine were not expired, nor was there soap in my package like some of the other reviews said. The only thing I can think of is that the sunflower oil may have oxidized - this is when the polyunsaturated fats go rancid, like if you've ever had whole wheat flour that's been at room temperature for too many months, which leaves a bitter off taste like this.Cheezits use a mix of palm oil (will not oxidize quickly) and soybean oil (does oxizidize quickly), while these used \\\"expeller pressed sunflower oil\\\" (extremely prone to oxidation in this 'virgin' form, needs to be fresh but is somewhat healthier than palm or soybean if it is fresh). Regular cheezits also contain a scary sounding 'industrial' chemical called TBHQ which delays oxidation, while these don't appear to, meaning they will go rancid faster than cheezits.This could explain why some people are happy with theirs - they got theirs while the sunflower oil was still fresh, while other people got it before the sell by date but after the oil oxidized. That is a theory anyway. Regardless I will be throwing these out and not getting them again.

Certainly there are better donuts to be had.  Maybe it's nostalgia; my father would sometimes wake up early on a Saturday morning and take a walk up to the grocery store to buy a morning newspaper, cigarettes and a box of donuts for us kids to enjoy when we woke up.  Not these particular donuts, however.  These weren't carried by the grocery store, they featured Hostess and Dolly Madison back then.When my son was young he latched onto a box of these while my wife and I were shopping.  I couldn't say NO to him, they were on a table at the back corner of the store and priced at $1.  It would be my first experience with \\\"The Chocolate Wax Donut\\\".  And though I don't often eat these anymore my son sure loves them.So what's so good about them?  Well, in my book it's pretty simple.  First off you have to put them in the refrigerator so that they don't melt because then they are slimy.  Keep them good and waxy!  Next, pour yourself a tall glass of milk.  But leave some room in the glass.  Break the donut in half and dip it into the milk.  Hold it there for 2-3 seconds to get it good and saturated, then remove from the glass and hold it with the soaked end facing up so that the milk continues to filter into the cake inside.  Now enjoy!  It just tastes so good.

The characters are great, including my top three favorites known as Saeyoung, Saeran, and Yoosung.But...what does that have to do with this product?I'll tell you.Saeyoung Choi, AKA 707, has a favorite snack that consists of Honey Butter Chips and Ph. D Pepper. Even better these look like the exact same brand, only the ones I recieved had the writing in English as pictured. I didn't think these were real until I decided to look them up on Amazon last week. As soon as I saw them and they have mainly good reviews, I decided to buy them.PACKAGING:As you can see no chip bag was ripped, hence I found no chips scattered in the box. They had those plastic puffy bags on the top, just enough to keep them in place. The chips are also up to date, and won't expire until six months from now.PRICE:You can choose how many bags, so of course the price varies. These are three bags of them, bigger than the snack size but smaller than a regular bag of chips you would get at a grocery store. I bought the three PC one, which I got for $10 and somethings cents.For someone like me who lives in the U.S. and can't get these chips anywhere else, $10 for three bags of a Korean product is not considered expensive. Each of the three bags would be about $3 a PC on their own, so it's fair.FLAVOR:I'll do my best, I'm not Daym Drops.It's as it says all over the bags, HONEY BUTTER. The chips remind me of Lay's but not as thin and won't break at even the lightest touch like Lay's. When you bite into it, there is that beautiful, crispy crunchy sound as you would get with any other chip similar to it.It's not a salty chip, but sweet instead and not overly so. The chips is a sweet buttery flavor with a hint of honey to it. Nothing is too strong in flavor, everything is just right; you know, you can taste the potato chip.Everything balanced.Doctor Who introduced me to Jelly Babies, I enjoyed those.Mystic Messenger introduced me to Honey Butter chips, I enjoyed those as well.Thanks Saeyoung!\", \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2021\", \"verified\": \"Verified Purchase\"}; {\"author\": \"Strawberry\", \"rating\": \"4.0 \", \"title\": \"they taste very strongly of butter\", \"content\": \"I, like most people who bought this, bought it because of mysmes and it it nothing like i thought it would be. the bags were bigger than i thought theyd be. smaller than the big chips bags as the store but  bigger then  the smaller ones.now onto the flavour, they taste so much like butter and are very sweet. i dont like how they taste but ive found that the more  you eat the better they taste and they pair very nice with soda\", \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2021\", \"verified\": \"Verified Purchase\"}; {\"author\": \"Kelly\", \"rating\": \"5.0 \", \"title\": \"Delicious and addictive\", \"content\": \"I tried another version of this while visiting Japan.

THE SEAL WAS TOO POWERFUL. maybe because of the people reporting opened bags? i\\u2019m not sure but these were way too powerful to open. finally after about a minute or two, i opened it. and immediately came the scent of sweet butter. it smelled nice, but that\\u2019s just me. i ate one single chip and i was...shocked. i can understand why people say that it tastes like plastic. it has a wack aftertaste but when eating the chip, it was like sweet flavored butter. i mean, i\\u2019m not sure exactly about honey but i definitely taste the butter. my brother didn\\u2019t like it because of the aftertaste but i could probably eat these like popcorn. i mean, i\\u2019m not gonna be like seven or yoosung and just eat bag after bag, but these were really good on the first go. i am however concerned with the chemical warning lmao. that is very concerning. but other than that, these taste pretty good. even though it would take a powerful god (like seven lol) to open the chips, these are pretty good.\", \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2021\", \"verified\": \"Verified Purchase\"}; {\"author\": \"alfredo aranda \", \"rating\": \"1.0 \", \"title\": null, \"content\": \"El pedido dice 3 bolsas y nom\\u00e1s lleg\\u00f3 una y dice que no se puede devolver el producto grande estafa\", \"date\": \"Reviewed in Mexico on November 5, 2023\", \"verified\": \"Verified Purchase\"}; {\"author\": \"Robin \", \"rating\": \"5.0 \", \"title\": null, \"content\": \"the chips expired june 3 2021, and I ordered them in October! disappointed because they\\u2019re so good and expensive\", \"date\": \"Reviewed in Canada on October 16, 2021\", \"verified\": \"Verified Purchase\"}; {\"author\": \"Mrs. Pjm Knighton\", \"rating\": \"5.0 \", \"title\": null, \"content\": \"I loved these, they are completely different to any other crisp I've tried.

This assortment is like a candy cornucopia with a twist, and I'm here to break it down for you.First of all, the packaging gets extra points for its Halloween vibes. The box looks like it could have come straight from a witch's candy stash - vibrant colors and eerie illustrations that scream, \\\"Boo! I'm delicious!\\\" It's so tempting that it's almost scary.Now, on to the candy sticks themselves. The variety in this pack is amazing. There are eight different flavors, and it's like a spooky roulette every time you reach for one. I mean, who wouldn't be intrigued by the idea of mystery-flavored taffy? It's like playing Russian Roulette, but with much tastier consequences.The texture of these Hi-Chew sticks is where the magic happens. They're soft and chewy, with a satisfying taffy-like consistency that leaves you pulling stretchy candy ghosts from your mouth. It's like a workout for your jaw, but the payoff is sweet (literally).The flavors are truly a mixed bag of Halloween tricks and treats. You've got classics like strawberry and green apple, which are like the familiar faces at a costume party. Then there are surprises like lychee and mango, which are like the guests who show up wearing the most unexpected costumes \\u2013 exotic and exciting.The taste is where the real fun begins. Some flavors are so spot-on that you'd think Hi-Chew had a witch's brew in their candy-making laboratory. Others might be a bit more acquired, but hey, that's what Halloween is all about - trying new things and getting a little spooked in the process.As for the sweetness, it's just right. Not too overpowering, so you can indulge without feeling like you're in a candy coma. You can snack on these bad boys while watching your favorite horror movies, and they'll never steal the show. They're the perfect co-stars.Now, some may say that Hi-Chew Candy Sticks are a bit pricey for Halloween candy, but remember, you're not just buying candy \\u2013 you're investing in a spooktacular experience that's sure to thrill both your taste buds and your party guests.In conclusion, the Hi-Chew Candy Sticks Variety Pack is the ultimate Halloween candy for those who like a little adventure with their sweet treats. It's the trick-or-treating experience you've been missing in your life. Whether you're handing them out to trick-or-treaters or enjoying them all by yourself, these Hi-Chew sticks are a winner.

AND USEFUL for someone looking for a fun way to produce natural saliva from a good but tangy flavor.First know,  I am not normally a candy guy, but I found the taste and texture of this so unusual and yummy I wanted others outside of Japan or other countries where it is widely sold and marketed to know about it.  It comes packaged like a pack of chewing gum in blocks.  But it is not gum.  though its texture is like that of gum initially,  really flavorful classic Grape Kool aid flavor gum.  It is also chewey like gum though it does over time get softer and softer and it is meant to be swallowed.  But what really makes its so neat is that one the flavor is reminiscent of that childhood perfect candy grape flavor and where it is sweet and tangy and makes your mouth water.  Also it chews just like gum except the flavor does not get less and less like gum.  it stays pungent with a nice mix of sweet and tangy Grape flavor until it gets so soft you just swallow it or you can let it slowly dissolve in your mouth.  I have had to be on some medications that can cause my mouth to get really dry and very few things can move my latent salivary glands to produce more saliva.  And while this product does have sugar in it.  it is still the best way I have found to produce my own moisture.  Also one or two pieces can really be satisfying and you have a nice flavor in your mouth and you do not need to keep eating the candy.  I have never seen another item like this where the texture starts out like a bubble gum block and then you chew on it to get this explosion of Grape Kool aide flavor that never lessens until you swallow it.  its like the gum you always wanted but never got in that the flavor stays and you can swallow it when you are done chewing.  Grape is by far and away my favorite flavor though I have tried strawberry and Pear  with friends and  some like the strawberry better.  None of the flavors taste bad.  in fact that is the other cool thing is that the whole theme of their flavor variety is a sweet and tangy take on natural fruit flavors.  I have given a piece to many unsuspecting people at this point and almost every time,  they either immediately say \\\"WOW! what is this stuff?\\\"  or they come back and make a point to ask me about it later. I even gave it to a guy in my neighborhood grocery store and he ran up to me the next time I came in the store and took down all the information on what the candy was and how and where he can get it.  Other than Amazon where they charge a fair price for a full case of the stuff -- usually around 11 dollars.  You might find the candy in single form for about a dollar and some change a package -- the case comes with ten packs and I cannot stress how fun and good this is.  If anyone who is reading this is looking for a great way to occasionally pop a treat in their mouth that will produce a ton of their own moisture, its great for that too,  You just chew it a bit then let it sort of sit there like candy gum and it will just gush out its flavor. If I had to bet which would be the most popular flavor I would say it would be grape.  But then I always had a weakness for certain childhood flavors of good kool-aid.  if you wanted to put a sweet tangy grape taste in your mouth that you could chew on like gum for a while and then either just suck on it and let it shed its flavor just like it was new or to chew it till it was so hot, chewed and soft that you could swallow it.  This is your candy.  I could have used  the taffy texture for this but it really is not sticky until the very end when one might be prone to swallow it.  -- of course coming through Amazon,  it came quickly well packaged and ready to go. totally fun thing to have around the house to put in a travel bag for something sweet to have as a change from sugar free gum which i also carry.  and a fun treat that will totally mesmerize western kids of all ages.  if you look at the individual piece it even has neat detailing as the outside is a milky white but in the center there is purple center for grape, red for strawberry and so forth.  Very reminiscent of Jelly Bellies.  if someone eats healthy most of the time but are looking for fun treats that can satisfy for a while with just a piece or two and are unique -- I would definitely try this candy out.  It is very Japanese with its focus on details. and that the texture of the candy is as cool as the taste.  and the grape taste is clean is that makes any sense.  no super gross chemical aftertaste.  If you know your taste is different then perhaps you can try something other than Grape but for me Grape is the best and it seems to have the most universal appeal. I wanted to check out and see if they had a mango or orange flavor too.  I would love to give these out on halloween if they had a smaller pack to give out.  In my opinion its a cannot miss.  maybe you will love it maybe you will just like it,  but I would be shocked if you did not at least really like it.  And all this from a guy who is not into candy and usually only has sugar free spearmint gum.\", \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2013\", \"verified\": \"Verified Purchase\"}; {\"author\": \"SIR R D M\", \"rating\": \"5.0 \", \"title\": \"Best Bananna Chewy Around!\", \"content\": \"Great flavor & texture!!!!\", \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2024\", \"verified\": \"Verified Purchase\"}; {\"author\": \"Amazon Customer\", \"rating\": \"5.0 \", \"title\": \"I love these\", \"content\": \"I love these and we can't get them at stores where I live.

        "reviews": "{\"author\": \"lV\", \"rating\": \"5.0 \", \"title\": \"Protein, Fiber and Taste\", \"content\": \"The Quest Cookies and Cream protein bar is packed with 21g of protein, 13 g of fiber, only 1 g of sugar, 190 calories and a pleasant taste. The bar is a little harder than cookie dough but is still soft and chewy. It is not as sweet as cookie dough but still tastes somewhat sweet and more like a treat than a high protein, high fiber product.Quest accomplishes the good taste without all the sugar by using the sugar alcohol Erythritol.Erythritol has been shown to be safe as it is excreted from the body in an unchanged form and is less likely to upset the digestive tract as it goes through the bloodstream and is excreted in urine rather than being passed through the digestive tract where other sugar alcohols can be fermented, resulting in digestive issues. Additionally, Erythritol does not result in increases in blood sugar and insulin (important for diabetics or those trying to lose weight or with insulin resistance).The ingredients indicate that these bars contain almonds. I can't digest nuts or legumes, however I don't taste the nuts and have not had any issues with digesting these bars, which has made me happy, because almonds have a number of nutritional benefits, but I'm guessing the amount present is probably pretty small, although they rank relatively high on the ingredient list.In terms of the proteins and fiber, Quest uses a blend of milk protein isolate and whey protein isolate, which has been shown to have a good yield and blend of amino acids. The fiber is in the form of polydextrose, a common prebiotic fiber.Overall, Quest has found a formula to make a tasty nutrition bar that is both high in protein and high in fiber (a benefit that most protein bars don't include), while being very low in sugar. Nutritionally these bars seem to offer a lot of benefits as well as being a tasty treat.\", \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2024\", \"verified\": \"Verified Purchase\"}; {\"author\": \"Rene Grigorian\", \"rating\": \"5.0 \", \"title\": \"Great snack!

After I pulled this beast out of the pantry the music stopped... people stopped drinking their alcohol, dancing in the kitchen, talking on the couch, and eating the other worthless snacks. The party very quickly shifted to the center of my living room. The focus was unreal, all it took was one guy trying to toss a goldfish in the air and catch it in his mouth. We had a circle of about 10 people, all with a handful of the tastiest fish around, tossing the goldfish for others to catch. People that previously didn't get along were now laughing and trying to catch as many goldfish as they could. That's when I realized... Flavor blasted Goldfish aren't just a snack, in fact... they are way more than that. Flavor Blasted Xtra Cheddar Goldfish are a way to bring people together, to solve lifelong grudges and hardships. On the outside they just look like a happy very powdered fish shaped cracker, but they are on a different level than any other snack I have ever tried. They taste like they aren't just blasted with flavor, but blasted with love and happiness. For hours we experienced the greatness that is Xtra Cheddar Goldfish.  We didn't need alcohol or drugs, this was so much more than that. I will never forget that night and I will never have a party without a 30 Oz Carton of Xtra Cheddar Flavor Blasted Pepperidge Farm Goldfish Crackers.To put the great value of this product into perspective - If you attend a party with a carton of Xtra Cheddar Goldfish you will be more respected than the guy that brought the $80 bottle of alcohol, but don't look down on him...

I had the cookie dough than I started buying them at Ralphs and was going through them quick so I ordered about 120 bars (all fudge graham) on amazon. I have dedicated whole draw to them in the kitchen.So back to my protein levels and minerals levels were low and I eat about 4 a day and had to get another blood test and my levels were all better the only thing I added was more ZONE bars.Also they aren't high in sugar and the Fudge Graham reminds me of s'mores and I LOVE s'mores.I also find them reasonably priced compared to other bar that taste like cardboard. I dont eat a lot in general Im real picky and I need a lot of bang for my buck so the bars are like my total got to for a protein bar.What's important to me especially at my age (middle age) is that they have no artificial anything!!Also they are never dry they are moist I can't get enough of the texture its so awesome.They are hands down the only bar I can eat now.

Its range of mints and fruit-flavored candies is known for its distinctive packaging, coming in paper-wrapped aluminum foil rolls.Candy manufacturer Clarence Crane of Garrettsville, Ohio (father of the poet Hart Crane) invented the brand in 1912 as a \\\"summer candy\\\" that could withstand heat better than chocolate. The candy's name is since its shape resembles that of a traditional ring-style life preserver also known as a \\\"life saver\\\".After registering the trademark, Crane sold the rights to his Pep-O-Mint peppermint candy to Edward John Noble for $2,900. Instead of using cardboard rolls, which were not very successful, Noble created tin-foil wrappers to keep the mints fresh. Noble founded the Life Savers and Candy Company in 1913 and significantly expanded the market for the product by installing Life Savers displays next to the cash registers of restaurants and grocery stores. He also encouraged the owners of the establishments to always give customers a nickel in their change to encourage sales of the 5\\u00a2 Life Savers. The slogan \\\"Still only 5 cents\\\" helped Life Savers to become a favorite treat for children with a tight allowance. Since then, many different flavors of Life Savers have been produced. The five-flavor roll first appeared in 1935.A series of mergers and acquisitions by larger companies began in 1956. Life Savers is currently a property of Mars, Incorporated. In recent decades, the brand expanded to include Gummi Savers in 1992, Life Saver Minis in 1996, Creme Savers in 1998, and Life Saver Fusions in 2001. Discontinued varieties include Fruit Juicers, Holes, Life Saver Lollipops, and Squeezit.Life Savers was first created in 1912 by Clarence Crane, a Garrettsville, Ohio, candy maker (and father of the famed poet Hart Crane). Clarence had switched from the maple sugar business to chocolates the year before, but found that they sold poorly in the summer, because air conditioning was rare, and they melted. He saw a machine pharmacies used to make pills that were round and wafer-shaped, and thought he'd use those to make mints, which at the time were made square (because they were pressed in sheets and then sliced into squares). The machinery could also punch a hole in the center, and Crane named the candy after its resulting life preserver shape.In 1913, Crane sold the formula for his Life Savers candy to Edward Noble of Gouverneur, New York for $2,900. Noble started his own candy company and began producing and selling the mints known as Pep-O-Mint Life Savers. He also began to package the mints into rolls wrapped in tin foil to keep them from going stale. This process was done by hand until 1919 when machinery was developed by Edward Noble's brother, Robert Peckham Noble, to streamline the process.In 1921, the company began to produce solid fruit drops. In 1925, technology improved to allow a hole in the center of the fruit candies. These were introduced as the \\\"fruit drop with the hole\\\" and came in Orange, Lemon and Lime, each of which were packaged in their own separate rolls. In contrast to the opaque white mints previously produced by the company, these new candies were crystal-like in appearance. These new flavors quickly became popular with the public. Four new flavors were quickly introduced, namely, anise, butter rum, cola and root beer, which were made in the clear fruit drop style. Other than butter rum, which remains in the brand's lineup of flavors, these did not prove to be as popular as the three original fruit drop flavors. In 1931, the Life Savers \\\"Cough Drop\\\" was introduced with menthol, but it was not successful. In 1931, rolls of pineapple and cherry fruit drops were also introduced. As the public response proved positive for these, a new variety of mint called Cryst-O-Mint, made in this same crystal-like style, was introduced in 1932. In 1935, the classic \\\"Five Flavor\\\" rolls were introduced, offering a selection of five different flavors (pineapple, lime, orange, cherry, and lemon) in each roll. This flavor lineup was unchanged for nearly 70 years, until 2003, when three of the flavors were replaced in the United States, making the rolls pineapple, cherry, raspberry, watermelon, and blackberry. However, orange was subsequently reintroduced .\\u2022 1912: Crane's Peppermint Life Savers created by Clarence Crane in Garrettsville, Ohio.\\u2022 1913: Edward Noble bought the Life Saver formula, renamed Pep-O-Mint Life Savers, and started Mint Products Company in New York City.\\u2022 1921: The first fruit flavors were produced as solid candies.\\u2022 1925: Technology improved to allow a hole in the center of the fruit candies.\\u2022 1927: Cherry flavor is invented and added to regular flavors.\\u2022 1935: The original Five Flavor roll of Life Savers debuted.\\u2022 1956: Life Savers Limited merged with Beech-Nut.\\u2022 1968: Beech-Nut Life Savers merged with Squibb.\\u2022 1981: Nabisco Brands Inc. acquired Life Savers from the E.R.

Just buy them already!\", \"content\": \"*Update to my Update*:I just must really be an idiot. I went through the entire box and it looks as though the rest of the packages are 5 oz. Now I am seriously questioning if the bag I had was from the box (I am 90% certain), but cannot absolutely prove it. I am returning my review to 5 stars for benefit of the doubt, that I am silly, and there really were 12 x 5oz packages in the box. I jumped to conclusions before going through the entire box and was just looking at the bag I had in my purse. I am almost certain that it came from the box because I have not pirchased any recently before or after rhis box. Honestly, even 11 x 5oz and 1 x 2.25oz packages are fine too for the price, albeit a bit shady or a simple accident, but I am fine with it wither way and overall. Sorry for the terrible rant below, please diregard. My original review below the update still stands.*Update*:Whoa! Wait a minute! I ordered a 12pk of *5oz* bags of Welch's Fruit Snacks! I actually received a 12 pk of *2.25oz* bags of Welch's Fruit Snacks. Now this I am *not* ok with! I made the purchase based on value. I could have bought these at the gas station for less at the full convenience markup! As sad as I am to say, and even though they were excellent, I will *not* be ordering again! I was duped. There are no returns. There is ZERO recourse to my issue. This is a serious problem. I understand no returns, maybe, but when the order is completely wrong on the Seller's end? I don't think that is legal. It is misrepresenting themselves and their products for sale! I only happened to notice this because I got to thinking that the bags seemed small and then going through the reviews SOMEONE ELSE mentioned the same thing happening! Once, ok....fix the fluke, but clearly this is ongoing! I am changing my 5 star review to 1 star until this is rectified or I am given half my money back for half the product I received!*I love Welch's fruit snacks...a lot! I like the larger sized bags because the little bags are too small for me and too much waste with all the little packets. I hate paying convenience markups at the grocery store, gas station, or at my workplace store, so thought I'd give it a try buying online. Not disappointed! They are fresh, soft, and tasty just like when I buy from the before mentioned places and cost much less! I can pack a bag for the day or throw in my bag for a snack at work and not have a bunch of tiny ones to carry around. I was wanting the large resealable bag, but honestly, the 2.25oz bags are great size-wise. I think the huge ones would be a lot to carry around. I can easily finish a 2.25oz bag and be done with it than to haul around a huge bag and hope they were completely sealed. I am sad that you can't subscribe to these and even the dash button makes you choose a seller. Small hassles, but I am rating the overall product and supplier. There was one that you could do this with (and was a couple bucks cheaper), but apparently became unavailable forever, and not just temporarily (or I would have just waited). Overall I am pleased with the purchase experience and quality of the product. The expiration date on the bulk box shows 6/2020 wich is a bit over 6 months away. I don't feel like that is too short an expiration because these will grow hard after too long and this is a good timeframe for maximum freshness and softness. I would think these had been manufactured recently based on the expiration date.\", \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2020\", \"verified\": \"Verified Purchase\"}; {\"author\": \"Laura Alford\", \"rating\": \"5.0 \", \"title\": \"Perfect Reward for my Students\", \"content\": \"This snack is perfect for my students!
