Its range of mints and fruit-flavored candies is known for its distinctive packaging, coming in paper-wrapped aluminum foil rolls.Candy manufacturer Clarence Crane of Garrettsville, Ohio (father of the poet Hart Crane) invented the brand in 1912 as a \\\"summer candy\\\" that could withstand heat better than chocolate. The candy's name is since its shape resembles that of a traditional ring-style life preserver also known as a \\\"life saver\\\".After registering the trademark, Crane sold the rights to his Pep-O-Mint peppermint candy to Edward John Noble for $2,900. Instead of using cardboard rolls, which were not very successful, Noble created tin-foil wrappers to keep the mints fresh. Noble founded the Life Savers and Candy Company in 1913 and significantly expanded the market for the product by installing Life Savers displays next to the cash registers of restaurants and grocery stores. He also encouraged the owners of the establishments to always give customers a nickel in their change to encourage sales of the 5\\u00a2 Life Savers. The slogan \\\"Still only 5 cents\\\" helped Life Savers to become a favorite treat for children with a tight allowance. Since then, many different flavors of Life Savers have been produced. The five-flavor roll first appeared in 1935.A series of mergers and acquisitions by larger companies began in 1956. Life Savers is currently a property of Mars, Incorporated. In recent decades, the brand expanded to include Gummi Savers in 1992, Life Saver Minis in 1996, Creme Savers in 1998, and Life Saver Fusions in 2001. Discontinued varieties include Fruit Juicers, Holes, Life Saver Lollipops, and Squeezit.Life Savers was first created in 1912 by Clarence Crane, a Garrettsville, Ohio, candy maker (and father of the famed poet Hart Crane). Clarence had switched from the maple sugar business to chocolates the year before, but found that they sold poorly in the summer, because air conditioning was rare, and they melted. He saw a machine pharmacies used to make pills that were round and wafer-shaped, and thought he'd use those to make mints, which at the time were made square (because they were pressed in sheets and then sliced into squares). The machinery could also punch a hole in the center, and Crane named the candy after its resulting life preserver shape.In 1913, Crane sold the formula for his Life Savers candy to Edward Noble of Gouverneur, New York for $2,900. Noble started his own candy company and began producing and selling the mints known as Pep-O-Mint Life Savers. He also began to package the mints into rolls wrapped in tin foil to keep them from going stale. This process was done by hand until 1919 when machinery was developed by Edward Noble's brother, Robert Peckham Noble, to streamline the process.In 1921, the company began to produce solid fruit drops. In 1925, technology improved to allow a hole in the center of the fruit candies. These were introduced as the \\\"fruit drop with the hole\\\" and came in Orange, Lemon and Lime, each of which were packaged in their own separate rolls. In contrast to the opaque white mints previously produced by the company, these new candies were crystal-like in appearance. These new flavors quickly became popular with the public. Four new flavors were quickly introduced, namely, anise, butter rum, cola and root beer, which were made in the clear fruit drop style. Other than butter rum, which remains in the brand's lineup of flavors, these did not prove to be as popular as the three original fruit drop flavors. In 1931, the Life Savers \\\"Cough Drop\\\" was introduced with menthol, but it was not successful. In 1931, rolls of pineapple and cherry fruit drops were also introduced. As the public response proved positive for these, a new variety of mint called Cryst-O-Mint, made in this same crystal-like style, was introduced in 1932. In 1935, the classic \\\"Five Flavor\\\" rolls were introduced, offering a selection of five different flavors (pineapple, lime, orange, cherry, and lemon) in each roll. This flavor lineup was unchanged for nearly 70 years, until 2003, when three of the flavors were replaced in the United States, making the rolls pineapple, cherry, raspberry, watermelon, and blackberry. However, orange was subsequently reintroduced .\\u2022 1912: Crane's Peppermint Life Savers created by Clarence Crane in Garrettsville, Ohio.\\u2022 1913: Edward Noble bought the Life Saver formula, renamed Pep-O-Mint Life Savers, and started Mint Products Company in New York City.\\u2022 1921: The first fruit flavors were produced as solid candies.\\u2022 1925: Technology improved to allow a hole in the center of the fruit candies.\\u2022 1927: Cherry flavor is invented and added to regular flavors.\\u2022 1935: The original Five Flavor roll of Life Savers debuted.\\u2022 1956: Life Savers Limited merged with Beech-Nut.\\u2022 1968: Beech-Nut Life Savers merged with Squibb.\\u2022 1981: Nabisco Brands Inc. acquired Life Savers from the E.R.

I bought these, the 30ct of the 4 different packs of mini cookies, the 60ct of gold fish, a 90ct of full sized air heads, and a bag of chocolate Halloween candy on here. All of the snacks were much cheaper than at our retail stores, so I was worried thing's would come broken up or smashed, but everything actually came great and in time. With the exception of the bottom of this box. It got a little smashed in transit, but thankfully it didn't affect the cookie packs.I actually checked each pack of these and not a single cookie felt broken or crumbled, and they had the correct amount of each item. My own kid's were definitely more excited doing it this was, as well. The parent's who stopped by joked that we had a little assembly line going between my oldest daughter, her friend, my mom, and I.

        "reviews": "{\"author\": \"Donuts\", \"rating\": \"5.0 \", \"title\": \"Great tasting snack...if you get the Japanese Pocky\", \"content\": \"I bought these back in January and never got around to reviewing them. I had heard many people rave about a Japanese snack called Pocky so I figured I would try it out. Just like the description states, its a biscuit stick covered in chocolate. I wouldn't say the taste is mind boggling but its very easy to eat and virtually no mess, well, as long as the chocolate doesn't melt. Anyways, in case anyone is wondering, I ordered from a seller named Very asia (amazon.com/gp/help/seller/at-a-glance.html?ie=UTF8&isAmazonFulfilled=0&orderID=103-7071944-5595443&marketplaceSeller=1&seller=A3JW437I54SEI1). I believe it took around a 3 weeks to actually get to me (maybe it had to be imported) but when it did, it came well packed and not damaged whatsoever. I'm definitely considering re-stocking on this in the future if I can't find a local storeEDIT: Oct 11, 2012*****Inquire the type of pocky from seller before finalizing purchase*****So I decided to restock after I couldn't fight the craving anymore. Unfortunately the batch this time was not so good (ordered from different seller because it was cheaper and through Amazon Prime). What I received was not the picture shown on the front page (2 per pack japanese pocky), it was a 1 per pack pocky~ish thing from Thailand. In my opinion, the 1 giant pack compared to 2 smaller packs is definitely a step back. Packaging was fine and I ordered in October when the weather was a bit cooler aka no melted chocolate arriving at the front door. The sticks were coated in some type of thick chocolate that was a bit bitter to the taste, more similar to dark chocolate than milk chocolate. The original Japanese pocky melted almost immediately in your mouth, this one melts slowly as it sits in your mouth.Personally I like the taste of dark chocolate but not when used here as a pocky flavor. I also have terrible self control so I buy things that come in small portions in order to a) not eat everything at once and b) avoid making the fridge a mess by cluttering it with tons of opened items. I can honestly say that I won't be overeating when it comes to this batch of pocky because I and my stomach dislike it so much. I won't change my original rating because that still holds true for the Japanese pocky but if I were to rate only the Thailand pocky it would be a 3. The taste isn't \\\"terrible\\\" but its definitely not to my liking. If possible I will be uploading some pictures of what I received.\", \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2011\", \"verified\": \"Verified Purchase\"}; {\"author\": \"Aunt B\", \"rating\": \"5.0 \", \"title\": \"Tasty Snack, Suggest not ordering in Summer Time\", \"content\": \"Tasty crunchy biscuit stick.  Not bitter, not too sweet.  Really like this single serving of Pocky.  The package says \\\"Chocolate Cream\\\" but it tastes more like dark chocolate to me (yum!)I see that others are disappointed with the portion of the product.  Please look at the images and Product Description before ordering to ensure you are getting what you want. I can only find these single serving boxes at one place that is about 40 miles away from my home.  It is convenient and awesome that I can shop at Amazon.com and find this treat at about the same price as at that store of mine (at time of writing this is $1.02 here at Amazon).The packaging at the time of this writing is a single serving which is 24 sticks. The box has a scored top so you can pull the cardboard back and have a container to hold the sticks in (see photo).  Tear the top of the sealed mylar  bag and the biscuit part is presented with the chocolate side down so you only need to touch the biscuit. [I added pictures in the Customer Images of the product]If you never had Pocky before, give them a try!!!  However, I warn you to consider the outside temperatures before ordering any chocolate products online.  I did not consider it as I ordered a couple boxes for myself (in Texas) and sent a few to a friend of mine in Idaho in the month of July.  I just did not think about it.  It was discouraging to learn my friend, who never tried Pocky, was met with a package of biscuit sticks that were melted together and has to eat them in broken pieces as they bust when she tries to pull them apart (the chocolate firmed up on her).  She still said she likes them, said the taste is great.At my house, my packages are also melted together; however, the chocolate is still soft as well... my house is about 80 degrees at the moment.  I can pull mine apart with a bit of a mess as the chocolate does as chocolate will do.  I don't mind too much as I get to lick my fingers off and feel like a little kid once more (awesome right?!?!).  But it isn't any sort of treat to give to a guest as the presentation is well... messy.  Unless that is cool with your guests then Go For It!!!!!That being said, I think this product is great if you like a bit of dark chocolate with a light, crispy biscuit.\", \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2014\", \"verified\": \"Verified Purchase\"}; {\"author\": \"M. Thompson\", \"rating\": \"5.0 \", \"title\": \"I love this snack!\", \"content\": \"I'm not sure how you review something that's as subjective as taste, but suffice to say that if you like chocolate and graham cracker, you'll like this (it doesn't taste exactly like either of those, but that's the closest analogy for me).  The sticks themselves are a cracker of some kind, dipped in chocolate, with one end left just normal cracker to you don't get your fingers covered in chocolate while eating.Here's some of the nitty gritty details - each of the boxes contain two individually sealed packets, that contain probably 20 or so of the sticks.  The packets themselves are really cleverly designed, with a little slit cut in the folded part, you just grab both sides and pull, and it opens up the package without any hassle - gotta love Japanese product design!  :)  Another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the grabbing-side of the stick is right at the top.Each of the packets has 210 calories (90 from fat), and about 80mg of sodium - so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option.  It does contain milk, wheat, soybeans and sheanut - so if any of these are an issue for you, then you'll want to pass.  It also says on the packaging that the facility they're manufactured in also processes eggs and peanuts - the product doesn't use either of them, but the disclosure is nice if you're particularly sensitive to either.Overall a great snack at a great price - the 10 pack really is 20 of the packets, so that's quite a few snacks.  One note, if you live in a hot climate, don't order them in the summer because they will melt together (in shipping)!

After I pulled this beast out of the pantry the music stopped... people stopped drinking their alcohol, dancing in the kitchen, talking on the couch, and eating the other worthless snacks. The party very quickly shifted to the center of my living room. The focus was unreal, all it took was one guy trying to toss a goldfish in the air and catch it in his mouth. We had a circle of about 10 people, all with a handful of the tastiest fish around, tossing the goldfish for others to catch. People that previously didn't get along were now laughing and trying to catch as many goldfish as they could. That's when I realized... Flavor blasted Goldfish aren't just a snack, in fact... they are way more than that. Flavor Blasted Xtra Cheddar Goldfish are a way to bring people together, to solve lifelong grudges and hardships. On the outside they just look like a happy very powdered fish shaped cracker, but they are on a different level than any other snack I have ever tried. They taste like they aren't just blasted with flavor, but blasted with love and happiness. For hours we experienced the greatness that is Xtra Cheddar Goldfish.  We didn't need alcohol or drugs, this was so much more than that. I will never forget that night and I will never have a party without a 30 Oz Carton of Xtra Cheddar Flavor Blasted Pepperidge Farm Goldfish Crackers.To put the great value of this product into perspective - If you attend a party with a carton of Xtra Cheddar Goldfish you will be more respected than the guy that brought the $80 bottle of alcohol, but don't look down on him...

I think they're awesome. In fact, I wish Wise had a 50% salt variety, as does Lay's Classic. ...But I like Wise that much better. Wise chips are smaller than Lay's, thus much sweeter. In my opinion, they taste better.Wise also has its unique onion & garlic flavor of chips, which is one of my all-time favorite flavors of potato chip ever. I recommend them to anyone.I also think Dipsy Doodles are better than Fritos. They're noticeably milder, with less spice, tasting more like corn.Then there's Cheez Doodles. I cannot emphasize enough how much I think Cheez Doodles beat Cheetos. ...I'm always partial to the original puffs, but the crunchy wins too (the crunchy variety didn't exist when I was a kid). It's hands down, as far as I'm concerned, and I'm a Doodles fan for life.Incidentally, FritoLay isn't the only competition. Wise handily beats Herr and Utz, too, both of which are extremely salty.I hate to sound like an advertisement. Be assured, I'm in no way associated with Wise.

This assortment is like a candy cornucopia with a twist, and I'm here to break it down for you.First of all, the packaging gets extra points for its Halloween vibes. The box looks like it could have come straight from a witch's candy stash - vibrant colors and eerie illustrations that scream, \\\"Boo! I'm delicious!\\\" It's so tempting that it's almost scary.Now, on to the candy sticks themselves. The variety in this pack is amazing. There are eight different flavors, and it's like a spooky roulette every time you reach for one. I mean, who wouldn't be intrigued by the idea of mystery-flavored taffy? It's like playing Russian Roulette, but with much tastier consequences.The texture of these Hi-Chew sticks is where the magic happens. They're soft and chewy, with a satisfying taffy-like consistency that leaves you pulling stretchy candy ghosts from your mouth. It's like a workout for your jaw, but the payoff is sweet (literally).The flavors are truly a mixed bag of Halloween tricks and treats. You've got classics like strawberry and green apple, which are like the familiar faces at a costume party. Then there are surprises like lychee and mango, which are like the guests who show up wearing the most unexpected costumes \\u2013 exotic and exciting.The taste is where the real fun begins. Some flavors are so spot-on that you'd think Hi-Chew had a witch's brew in their candy-making laboratory. Others might be a bit more acquired, but hey, that's what Halloween is all about - trying new things and getting a little spooked in the process.As for the sweetness, it's just right. Not too overpowering, so you can indulge without feeling like you're in a candy coma. You can snack on these bad boys while watching your favorite horror movies, and they'll never steal the show. They're the perfect co-stars.Now, some may say that Hi-Chew Candy Sticks are a bit pricey for Halloween candy, but remember, you're not just buying candy \\u2013 you're investing in a spooktacular experience that's sure to thrill both your taste buds and your party guests.In conclusion, the Hi-Chew Candy Sticks Variety Pack is the ultimate Halloween candy for those who like a little adventure with their sweet treats. It's the trick-or-treating experience you've been missing in your life. Whether you're handing them out to trick-or-treaters or enjoying them all by yourself, these Hi-Chew sticks are a winner. Just be prepared for some ghoulishly good times and maybe even a few taste bud scares along the way!\", \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2023\", \"verified\": \"Verified Purchase\"}; {\"author\": \"R. Geist\", \"rating\": \"5.0 \", \"title\": \"I live in the US and I am not normally a candy guy -- that said -  this Japanese candy is awesome description below\", \"content\": \"So,  I live in the US and  this candy is fairly hard to find here unless you know about it or encounter it in the candy section of your world market.But I happened on it at a family run homestyle Japanese restaurant and it is really unusual but amazingly yummy.  AND USEFUL for someone looking for a fun way to produce natural saliva from a good but tangy flavor.First know,  I am not normally a candy guy, but I found the taste and texture of this so unusual and yummy I wanted others outside of Japan or other countries where it is widely sold and marketed to know about it.  It comes packaged like a pack of chewing gum in blocks.  But it is not gum.  though its texture is like that of gum initially,  really flavorful classic Grape Kool aid flavor gum.  It is also chewey like gum though it does over time get softer and softer and it is meant to be swallowed.  But what really makes its so neat is that one the flavor is reminiscent of that childhood perfect candy grape flavor and where it is sweet and tangy and makes your mouth water.  Also it chews just like gum except the flavor does not get less and less like gum.  it stays pungent with a nice mix of sweet and tangy Grape flavor until it gets so soft you just swallow it or you can let it slowly dissolve in your mouth.  I have had to be on some medications that can cause my mouth to get really dry and very few things can move my latent salivary glands to produce more saliva.  And while this product does have sugar in it.  it is still the best way I have found to produce my own moisture.  Also one or two pieces can really be satisfying and you have a nice flavor in your mouth and you do not need to keep eating the candy.  I have never seen another item like this where the texture starts out like a bubble gum block and then you chew on it to get this explosion of Grape Kool aide flavor that never lessens until you swallow it.  its like the gum you always wanted but never got in that the flavor stays and you can swallow it when you are done chewing.  Grape is by far and away my favorite flavor though I have tried strawberry and Pear  with friends and  some like the strawberry better.  None of the flavors taste bad.  in fact that is the other cool thing is that the whole theme of their flavor variety is a sweet and tangy take on natural fruit flavors.  I have given a piece to many unsuspecting people at this point and almost every time,  they either immediately say \\\"WOW! what is this stuff?\\\"  or they come back and make a point to ask me about it later. I even gave it to a guy in my neighborhood grocery store and he ran up to me the next time I came in the store and took down all the information on what the candy was and how and where he can get it.  Other than Amazon where they charge a fair price for a full case of the stuff -- usually around 11 dollars.  You might find the candy in single form for about a dollar and some change a package -- the case comes with ten packs and I cannot stress how fun and good this is.  If anyone who is reading this is looking for a great way to occasionally pop a treat in their mouth that will produce a ton of their own moisture, its great for that too,  You just chew it a bit then let it sort of sit there like candy gum and it will just gush out its flavor. If I had to bet which would be the most popular flavor I would say it would be grape.  But then I always had a weakness for certain childhood flavors of good kool-aid.  if you wanted to put a sweet tangy grape taste in your mouth that you could chew on like gum for a while and then either just suck on it and let it shed its flavor just like it was new or to chew it till it was so hot, chewed and soft that you could swallow it.  This is your candy.  I could have used  the taffy texture for this but it really is not sticky until the very end when one might be prone to swallow it.  -- of course coming through Amazon,  it came quickly well packaged and ready to go. totally fun thing to have around the house to put in a travel bag for something sweet to have as a change from sugar free gum which i also carry.  and a fun treat that will totally mesmerize western kids of all ages.  if you look at the individual piece it even has neat detailing as the outside is a milky white but in the center there is purple center for grape, red for strawberry and so forth.  Very reminiscent of Jelly Bellies.  if someone eats healthy most of the time but are looking for fun treats that can satisfy for a while with just a piece or two and are unique -- I would definitely try this candy out.  It is very Japanese with its focus on details. and that the texture of the candy is as cool as the taste.  and the grape taste is clean is that makes any sense.  no super gross chemical aftertaste.  If you know your taste is different then perhaps you can try something other than Grape but for me Grape is the best and it seems to have the most universal appeal. I wanted to check out and see if they had a mango or orange flavor too.  I would love to give these out on halloween if they had a smaller pack to give out.  In my opinion its a cannot miss.  maybe you will love it maybe you will just like it,  but I would be shocked if you did not at least really like it.  And all this from a guy who is not into candy and usually only has sugar free spearmint gum.\", \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2013\", \"verified\": \"Verified Purchase\"}; {\"author\": \"SIR R D M\", \"rating\": \"5.0 \", \"title\": \"Best Bananna Chewy Around!\", \"content\": \"Great flavor & texture!!!!\", \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2024\", \"verified\": \"Verified Purchase\"}; {\"author\": \"Amazon Customer\", \"rating\": \"5.0 \", \"title\": \"I love these\", \"content\": \"I love these and we can't get them at stores where I live.

Certainly there are better donuts to be had.  Maybe it's nostalgia; my father would sometimes wake up early on a Saturday morning and take a walk up to the grocery store to buy a morning newspaper, cigarettes and a box of donuts for us kids to enjoy when we woke up.  Not these particular donuts, however.  These weren't carried by the grocery store, they featured Hostess and Dolly Madison back then.When my son was young he latched onto a box of these while my wife and I were shopping.  I couldn't say NO to him, they were on a table at the back corner of the store and priced at $1.  It would be my first experience with \\\"The Chocolate Wax Donut\\\".  And though I don't often eat these anymore my son sure loves them.So what's so good about them?  Well, in my book it's pretty simple.  First off you have to put them in the refrigerator so that they don't melt because then they are slimy.  Keep them good and waxy!  Next, pour yourself a tall glass of milk.  But leave some room in the glass.  Break the donut in half and dip it into the milk.  Hold it there for 2-3 seconds to get it good and saturated, then remove from the glass and hold it with the soaked end facing up so that the milk continues to filter into the cake inside.  Now enjoy!  It just tastes so good.

And they were in good shape, not crushed.\", \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2024\", \"verified\": \"Verified Purchase\"}; {\"author\": \"Murky\", \"rating\": \"5.0 \", \"title\": \"Frito Bandito Hits Again!\", \"content\": \"I\\u2019d recently tried a box of 40 1oz packages of Crispy Cheetos, an old favorite. Good experience, so I thought I\\u2019d try some Fritos. I hadn\\u2019t eaten them in years, but remembered them as being a simple tasty snack. Good price when you compare to a vending machine offering or a mixed bag of snacks from the grocery store. Delivery was prompt, The Amazon Order Chauffeur was polite as he handed me the box, covered by another package containing an order for my wife. When I got inside, I noticed the tape sealing the top of the box was a bit weathered-looking. Sadly, closer inspection revealed that it looked like the tape had been picked at like an old scab and slid away to allow access to the box. \\u201cHeaven\\u2019s to Murgatroid\\u201d, I said to myself, as I slid the tape aside and accessed the contents as I suspected someone may have done before me.  I carefully removed the packages of Fritos, counting as I went. Thirty-nine, not forty. I counted again. 39/40ths of the delivery had survived the journey from Frito-lay to my door. I was crestfallen. A thief had intercepted my order of Fritos while it was in the hands of the manufacturer or the Amazon delivery system. My first thought was beneficial as I considered that maybe someone within the Fritos or Amazon empires was sadly hungry and perhaps wasn\\u2019t able to provide for their spouse and children. If I\\u2019d encountered them on the street while carrying a box of 40 packages of Fritos, I\\u2019d without a doubt offer more than a single package to help them out. My second thought was less generous as I considered that the individual who took advantage of an opportunity to purloin a package of Fritos had done more than grab a quick snack. They\\u2019d made me realize that I couldn\\u2019t trust Amazon to deliver anything to my home without the fear that someone within the system could easily f*** with my order. Being a food product, it was clear that removing one of 40 packets was not all that could have occurred. I looked at my options. There didn\\u2019t appear to be a way to complain other than to leave a review comment, which would probably be overlooked by many and read by few, most notably someone that I would typically consider eligible to hear a complaint. I could suck it up and just hope that the Frito Bandito hadn\\u2019t left anything behind other than a disgruntled customer. The difference between receiving 40 or 39 bags of Fritos is in the fraction range, so it\\u2019s not the cost. No, it\\u2019s the principle! I decided to return the product. The packaging and the contents were both damaged by the Frito Bandito, meaning I didn\\u2019t receive what I\\u2019d ordered. I entered the complaint system and took a look at something new for me. I could get a refund or I could get a replacement. I considered the taste memory of a bag of Fritos. I\\u2019ll go for the replacement, I thought. My wife had discovered that Amazon had made it easier to return things to Amazon, so I thought it would be easy to drop the fouled box of Fritos and wait for another. Here it is two days later and I have a fresh box of Fritos that hasn\\u2019t been obviously intruded upon by the Frito Bandito or any other scalawags. I\\u2019m feeling better. Frito-Lay said keep the original box, as well. That\\u2019s very generous. I like that, but will probably donate it. It has restored my faith to a degree, though and I\\u2019ll probably be ordering again.
